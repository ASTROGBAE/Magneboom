Magneboom Feature List by GBAE

Implemented:
- magneboom ore (drops 4-5 magnebooms)
- stable magneboom (purple color)
- volatile magneboom (orange color)
- remove magneboom block and replace with stable and volatile varients (purple color for stable)

Issues:

Planned:
- no crafting recipes for volatile or stable magneboom blocks
- volatile and stable magneboom drop when a magneboom ore is broken normally (higher chance of volatile and very small chance of stable)
- breaking a magneboom ore block will have a chance of exploding
- custom textures
- magneboom ore generation
